/**
 * See <a
 * href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IndividualClaimsRequests">5.5.1.
 * Individual Claims Requests</a>
 *
 * <p>Claim being requested.
 *
 * <p>The member values MUST be one of the following:
 *
 * <p>null Indicates that this Claim is being requested in the default manner. In particular, this
 * is a Voluntary Claim. For instance, the Claim request: "given_name": null requests the given_name
 * Claim in the default manner.
 *
 * <p>JSON Object
 *
 * <p>Used to provide additional information about the Claim being requested. This specification
 * defines the following members:
 *
 * <p>essential OPTIONAL. Indicates whether the Claim being requested is an Essential Claim. If the
 * value is true, this indicates that the Claim is an Essential Claim. For instance, the Claim
 * request: "auth_time": {"essential": true} can be used to specify that it is Essential to return
 * an auth_time Claim Value. If the value is false, it indicates that it is a Voluntary Claim. The
 * default is false. By requesting Claims as Essential Claims, the RP indicates to the End-User that
 * releasing these Claims will ensure a smooth authorization for the specific task requested by the
 * End-User. Note that even if the Claims are not available because the End-User did not authorize
 * their release or they are not present, the Authorization Server MUST NOT generate an error when
 * Claims are not returned, whether they are Essential or Voluntary, unless otherwise specified in
 * the description of the specific claim.
 *
 * <p>value OPTIONAL. Requests that the Claim be returned with a particular value. For instance the
 * Claim request: "sub": {"value": "248289761001"} can be used to specify that the request apply to
 * the End-User with Subject Identifier 248289761001. The value of the value member MUST be a valid
 * value for the Claim being requested. Definitions of individual Claims can include requirements on
 * how and whether the value qualifier is to be used when requesting that Claim.
 *
 * <p>values OPTIONAL. Requests that the Claim be returned with one of a set of values, with the
 * values appearing in order of preference. For instance the Claim request: "acr": {"essential":
 * true, "values": ["urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver", "urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze"]} specifies that
 * it is Essential that the acr Claim be returned with either the value urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver
 * or urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze. The values in the values member array MUST be valid values for
 * the Claim being requested. Definitions of individual Claims can include requirements on how and
 * whether the values qualifier is to be used when requesting that Claim.
