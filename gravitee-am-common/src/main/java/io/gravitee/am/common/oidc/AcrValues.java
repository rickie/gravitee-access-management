     * <p>Level 1 - Although there is no identity proofing requirement at this level, the
     * authentication mechanism provides some assurance that the same Claimant who participated in
     * previous transactions is accessing the protected transaction or data. It allows a wide range
     * of available authentication technologies to be employed and permits the use of any of the
     * token methods of Levels 2, 3, or 4. Successful authentication requires that the Claimant
     * prove through a secure authentication protocol that he or shepossesses and controls the
     * token. Plaintext passwords or secrets are not transmitted across a network at Level 1.
     * However this level does not require cryptographic methods that block offline attacks
     * byeavesdroppers. For example, simple password challenge-response protocols are allowed. In
     * many cases an eavesdropper, having intercepted such a protocol exchange, will be able to find
     * the password with a straightforward dictionary attack. At Level 1, long-term shared
     * authentication secrets may be revealed to Verifiers. At Level 1, assertions and assertion
     * references require protection from manufacture/modification and reuse attacks

     *
     * <p>Level 2 â€“ Level 2 provides single factor remote network authentication. At Level 2,
     * identity proofing requirements are introduced, requiring presentation of identifying
     * materials or information. A wide range of available authentication technologies can be
     * employed at Level 2. For single factor authentication, Memorized Secret Tokens,
     * Pre-Registered Knowledge Tokens, Look-up Secret Tokens, Out of Band Tokens, and Single Factor
     * One-Time Password Devices are allowed at Level 2. Level 2 also permits any of the token
     * methods of Levels 3 or 4. Successful authentication requires that the Claimant prove through
     * a secure authentication protocol that he or she controls the token. Online guessing, replay,
     * session hijacking, and eavesdropping attacks are resisted. Protocols are also required to be
     * at least weakly resistant to man-in-the middle attacks as defined in Section 8.2.2. Long-term
     * shared authentication secrets, if used, are never revealed to any other party except
     * Verifiers operated by the Credential Service Provider (CSP); however, session (temporary)
     * shared secrets may be provided to independent Verifiers by the CSP. In addition to Level 1
     * requirements, assertions are resistant to disclosure, redirection, capture and substitution
     * attacks. Approved cryptographic techniques are required for all assertion protocols used at
     * Level 2 and above.
